# OmniPortal

A simple student management system that allows users to register and login.

To get started, you can clone this repo, set the db credentials on the .env file and then run `./artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

A user by default is assigned a 'student' role
There are 2 more possible roles (staff and parent)

User `ivan@portal.test` password is just `password`
